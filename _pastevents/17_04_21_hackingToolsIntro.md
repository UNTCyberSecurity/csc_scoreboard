Join us this Friday as we teach you how to use some hacking hardware [from Hak5](https://www.hak5.org/)!

Tools we will be going over:

* [Wifi Pineapple](https://hakshop.com/products/wifi-pineapple): A device that's about redirecting devices on wifi to connect to you so you can be the ultimate busy body

* [Rubber Ducky](https://hakshop.com/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe): A keystroke injection tool with an easy to learn scripting language

* [Bash Bunny](https://hakshop.com/products/bash-bunny): An attack computer on a flash drive, the Bash Bunny not only tricks the target into thinking it's a multitude of devices but it is also a Linux box with terminal access

* [LAN Turtle](https://hakshop.com/products/lan-turtle): A piece of hardware that's designed to look like a generic IT device but when plugged in gives the penetration tester remote access to the device and network

* [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/): A small computer that can be used for a variety of projects. At this demo we're going to be going over how we can set this up with Kali Linux
