### What is National Cyber League?

[National Cyber League](https://www.nationalcyberleague.org/) (NCL) is a program for providing participants a place to develop and practice their cyber security skills.

NCL will provide a series of challenges for both individuals (pre/regular season) and teams (postseason) to compete and then rank them against their peers.

2. You will learn something new almost guaranteed
3. It's a lot of fun
4. Being able to list "I competed in National Cyber League" on a resume
5. Facebook and other major tech companies sponsor the event and will be looking over results
6. At the end you get a cool scouting report for yourself that looks like [this](https://media.wix.com/ugd/766e9a_909c9c29f721456dba14fa92039730fa.pdf)(PDF)

### I don't know anything about cyber security though

That's okay a lot of our members start out in the same position! A number of challenges in NCL can be solved just by knowing how to use Google to look up the information you need.
In addition to that you will have other members of the club available to ask questions if you get stuck.
