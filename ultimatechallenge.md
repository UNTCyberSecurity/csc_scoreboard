title: The Ultimate Challenge
---

Hello and welcome to the Cyber Security Club Ultimate Challenge!

This challenge will require you to research, study, understand and hopefully provide
you with new tools for you to use in your future. Each challenge will provide you with
a hint as to how to solve the next stage. At the end of this challenge we will be providing
the first 3 players, who are not part of frequent officer business, prizes. I encourage everyone
with experience or not to try to work your way around this challenge.

I ask for each player to work on this challenge by themselves, and do not cheat. I have no way
of knowing if you do or not, but you won't get anything out of this if you do. It would be literally
pointless to do so. I've put a lot of thought into this challenge, and hope you all get a chance to
work on it.

I understand that some of this content may be difficult for those who do not know much about security.
I will be providing help for those who are stuck on a particular stage, but I won't provide you the answer.
This challenge is meant to wet your feet in the topics of security. I encourage all of you to not stop here.
Sites such as overthewire, and project euler provide great ways of getting more experience in capture the flag
type games. Also for those who are into CTFs I would encourage you to visit [https://ctftime.org/](https://ctftime.org/).
Sign up for a game, or get a group of friends and do a team based game.

There are many resources online for you to use in-order to aid yourself. Remember, the more you get
frustrated, the more satisfactory the reward will be. If you run into any technical issues with the game,
please contact me, so I can correct the issue.
With that being said, let the games begin!

This challenge is available for anyone who would like to test their skills at a basic level of cyber security.
Each stage is set to confuse, promote critical thinking and encourage research.

You, a beginner hacker, are trying to get into the secret underground hacker group TSHG.
You have been contacted by Mr. Z with a challenge which must be solved before you are given entry to TSHG.
Mr. Z wonâ€™t help you, but he may provide you with details as far as what to do next. Do what Mr. Z asks of you,
and you may become a full-time member!

**Mr. Z:** Hello candidate, to prove your usefulness, I will put you through a test. There is a service online that
you must find. You need to find the IP address of this machine to access it. I will provide you with this two-part
encrypted/encoded message. See what you can do with it.
